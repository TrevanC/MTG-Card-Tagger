notes: >
  More precise, LLM-friendly descriptions. Clarified boundaries where regex doesn’t help.
  Tagging guidance: function_primary = choose 1–2; function_secondary = choose 0–4.
  “+1/+1_counters” strictly means +1/+1 counters (not generic P/T modification or -1/-1 counters).
  for interaction_axis, interaction means affecting, not just mentioning, mostly removal
  emphasis that interaction means affecting something somehow

enums:
